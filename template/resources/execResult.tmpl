You have executed {{ .Count }} tools and gathered the following information:

{{range $index, $tool := .ToolResults}}{{ $tool.Name }}:
   Result: {{ $tool.Result }}

{{end}}

## Analysis Instructions

Please analyze ALL the above tool results collectively and provide:

1. **Comprehensive Analysis**: What does the combined data tell us about the current state?

2. **Relationship Analysis**: How do these results relate to each other? Are there any contradictions or confirmations?

3. **Evidence-Based Conclusion**: Based on the concrete evidence above, what is your definitive conclusion?

4. **Evidence-Based Assessment**: What specific conclusions can be drawn from this analysis?

## Important Guidelines

- Base your response ONLY on the concrete data provided above
- Look for patterns, inconsistencies, or logical connections between the results
- Provide clear reasoning for your conclusions
- Do not make assumptions beyond what the data shows
- If the data suggests an update is possible, clearly state: "Yes, you can perform an update from X to Y"
- If the data shows no update is needed, clearly state: "No update is required"

## Required Response Format

End your analysis with a clear **Recommendations** section using this exact format:

```
## Recommendations

[Either provide specific actionable recommendations, or write "None" if no action is needed]
```

### Guidelines for Recommendations:
- **Actionable Items Only**: Only include recommendations that require user action or tool execution
- **Specific Actions**: Be explicit about what should be done (e.g., "Update OpenStack from version X to Y", "Restart the failed pods", "Scale up the service")
- **Clear Language**: Use direct, unambiguous language for recommendations
- **None When Appropriate**: If the analysis shows everything is working correctly or no action is needed, write "None"
